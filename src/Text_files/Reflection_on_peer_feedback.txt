I had planned to test each of the 5 wings at different angles, recording their lift and drag coefficients and the Reynold’s number. However, the suggestion to limit the number of factors gave me a revelation to how I can make my research more thorough. Hence, I decided to study only, and extensively, about the Concorde’s wing and limiting the independent variable to only the angle of attack. With this, I can reduce the complexity of my project and provide a more presentable product.
