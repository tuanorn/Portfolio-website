Within this week, a 3D model of the Concorde's wing will be produced, and research on analyzing CFD results will be completed. Next week will be dedicated to collecting Reynold's numbers and lift-to-drag ratios at different angles of attack; a 3D model must be produced or found before then. The physical model of the wing should be built right after the CFD data collection, giving a week and a half to gather materials and tools. Within the last week of November, a script will be prepared as a research paper with its implications researched.
